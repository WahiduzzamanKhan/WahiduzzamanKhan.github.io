<h2>
	Background
</h2>
<p>
	It is April of the year 2019 and people of Bangladesh has already faced 4 major fire breakouts in such a short period of time, killing more than a hundred. All these tragic events have revealed different aspects of our society. Some heroes are discovered and some are lost. Out of the curiosity, invoked by these incidents, I visited the official website of Bangladesh Fire Service and found some interesting data. They are about occurrences of emergencies, casualties, damage of property, the cause of the fire, etc. But unfortunately, these data were in Bengali, unorganized and in pdf format. Hence, I tried to clean them and visualize them in a way so that anyone can have an idea about the whole scenario just by taking a look at them.

<h2>
	Data Source
</h2>
<p>
	Data used here are available at the official website of the <a href="http://www.fireservice.gov.bd/">Bangladesh Fire Service</a>. But these data were very unorganized and pdf format. Hence I transformed them into a more usable and organized way. These cleaned data along with all the codes used to do the visualizations can be found <a href="https://github.com/WahiduzzamanKhan/Visualizing-Bangladesh-Fire-Service-Data">here</a>.

<h2>
	Number of Fire Hazards from 2004 - 2018
</h2>
<p>
	Here we have a bar chart showing the number of Fire Hazards that has occurred from 2004 to 2018. We can see that the number of incident increases almost every year. In just 15 years the number has more than doubled, which is a matter of great concern. It just showcases the incognizance and lack of awareness in the people.

<h2>
	Casualties by Fire Hazards from 2006 - 2018
</h2>
<p>
	This Graph shows us the Number of people that were killed or injured by fire hazards form 2006 to 2018. We can see more people were dead than injured in every year. Also the number of people that died exceeds the number of people that were injured by a lot. It is just sad and heart breaking to see such huge number of people dying an unfortunate death every year. But we can also find a little relief seeing that the number of casualties is decreasing, even though the number of incidents is increasing. Specially after 2013, we can observe an almost dramatical drop.

<h2>
	Damage of Property by Fire Hazards from 2004 - 2018
</h2>
<p>
	Every year a huge amount of property gets damaged because of fire breakouts. This graph shows us the amount of property that were damaged each year from 2004 to 2018 and the amount of property that our firemen were able to save from damaging. Here the amount is expressed in 10 crores (100000000 taka). The shows us that more properties are saved than damaged. But still, on average 371 crore taka worth of properties get damaged because of fire breakouts, which a very big amount.

<h2>
	Fire hazards in each division from 2014 - 2018
</h2>
<p>
	This graph shows the number of fire hazards that occurred in each devision from year 2014 - 2018. Dhaka is the most densely populated division of Bangladesh. So, it is not really surprising to see Dhaka achieving first place every year with nearly 6000 incidents per year. It also shows that Sylhet and Barisal are the most safe division in case of fire hazards.
