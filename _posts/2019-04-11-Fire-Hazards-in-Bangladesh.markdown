description: This is a personal project. Here I tried to visualize the data available on the official website of Bangladesh Fire Service so that it is more organized and easy to understand.<br>The data provided by the Fire Service website was very messy, unorganized. I have transformed the data to a more usable format. This cleaned data can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/WahiduzzamanKhan/Visualizing-Bangladesh-Fire-Service-Data/tree/master/Data">here</a>.<br>I used R to do the visualizations. The R codes can be found <a href="https://github.com/WahiduzzamanKhan/Visualizing-Bangladesh-Fire-Service-Data/tree/master/Codes">here</a>.<br>You can see the full report on this data <a href="http://wahiduzzamankhan.github.io/Visualizing-Bangladesh-Fire-Service-Data">here</a>
